            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p class="w3-padding-24">We live to connect. Our goal is to solve the national hunger problem by providing easy
                access to free relief
                resources.</p>
            <h3>How We Help</h3>
            <p>FoodEx is a service that connects food banks with people in need of assistance. By streamlining the signup
                process, food banks can focus on providing relief to those who qualify. Users can search for food banks in
                their area, and schedule a pickup at a convenient time. </p>
            <h3>Why it matters</h3>
            <p class="w3-padding-24">When someone uses a food bank, they usually have to go through a finance and background
                check for
                eligibility. FoodEx hopes to make this process as easy and anonymous as possible, helping you fix your
                circumstances with helpful resources. We also want to make the process of getting food as fast as possible
                since we know you have a busy schedule, so we have an optional scheduler to pick up food.</p>
